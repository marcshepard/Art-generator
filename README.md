Andrew Ng's Coursera course on Convolutional Neural Networks. 

A prereq to running art_generator.py is:
* Install a recent version of Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/. This script has been tested with Python 3.10
* Install the following Python packages:
    * PIL - Python image library
    * Tensorflow - a library for neural net deep learning
